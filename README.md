# Templete-appointment-schedular

This is a Template for Action on google that can be used to add to book an appointment in an Action.

Actions on Google is a development platform for the Google Assistant. It allows the third-party development of "actions"—applets for the Google Assistant that provide extended functionality.

The actions platform supports "direct" actions, as well as "conversational" actions for more complex applications. More advanced developers can develop directly against the API, and an SDK for Node.js is also available.

As of April 2017, there were more than 175 Actions for Google Assistant, including ones from Uber, The Motley Fool, NPR One, NBC News, and Domino's Pizza. The availability was further extended beyond the Google Home space into Android and iOS.
